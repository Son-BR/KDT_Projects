The school is sponsored by the Ford Motor Company, Wayne County Regional Educational Service Agency and The Henry Ford Museum and admits high school students. It is located in Dearborn, Michigan on the campus of the Henry Ford museum. Enrollment is taken from a lottery in the area and totaled 467 in 2010.[1]\n",

Classes are expected to include use of the museum artifacts, a tradition of the original Village Schools. When the Museum was established in 1929, it included a school which served grades kindergarten to college/trade school ages. The last part of the original school closed in 1969.\n",
